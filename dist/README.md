# Days.rocks

## info

This is the web client of [days.rocks](https://days.rocks).

Made for Projecten 1 at Odisee in Ghent

By [Haroen Viaene](https://haroen.me), [Elias Meire], [Arnaud Weyts](https://wetys.xyz)

## contributing

The front end uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and thus also [npm](https://www.npmjs.com).

To build the styles locally, you run:

```sh
gulp
```

If you only want gulp to build the files that have been changed, you can run after the previous command:

```sh
gulp watch
```

Deploying is done with ___[travis???](https://travis-ci.org)___ to a private server.
